# Clustering-Algorithms
K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering

1.  Implement three clustering algorithms to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression profiles: K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering with Single Link (Min) and DBSCAN. Choose an external index (Rand Index or Jaccard Coefficient) and compare the clustering results from different clustering algorithms. The ground truth clusters are provided in the datasets. Visualize data sets and clustering results by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

2.  Set up a single-node Hadoop cluster on your own machine and implement MapReduce K-means. Compare with non-parallel K-means on the given datasets.
